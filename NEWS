creoltools 0.0m-git (2009-XX-XX): alpha release.

This version implements new features.

In the language:
* Support for a Map data type and map literals have been added. See the
  manual for an explanation.
* A "choose" function has been added to the Set data type.

In the compiler:
* The type checking algorithm has been improved and will accept more
  well-typed programs than before.
* Errors in unification during type checking have been corrected.
* The internal data structures have been simplified, resulting in
  much more robust code generation and analysis.
* Well-formedness of interface declarations and uses are added.
* The compiler uses a new mechanism for selecting subtargets.
* Generated label names are proper identifiers now. The compiler can
  read its own output.

In the interpreter:
* The calls and returns are reference counted objects now.
* The interpreter format has been revised to accomodate for first-class
  futures.
* The interpreter is much more consistent now in setting up auxiliary
  attributes.
* Meta-level execution works now.

Other:
* Many errors have been corrected.
* The documentation has been improved.
* cmcvalid has been renamed to cmcdisplay and can also generate dot
  files now for visualising object structures.
* creolshell has been dropped, because it is unmaintained and should
  be replaced by the Eclipse plug-in.

creoltools 0.0m (2008-11-24): alpha release.

This version is mainly a bug fix release.  It includes some new language
features.

In the language:
* Subtypes are defined using the syntax "datatype S from T" instead of
  "datatype S of T".
* Support for pragmatic advice has been added.  The syntax is
  pragma type-name [ ( [ expr {, expr} ] ) ]
* Parenthesis for empty expression lists are optional in most places:
  "new C" and "new C ()" are accepted as equivalent.
* Loops can be annotated with a measure and order, i.e.,
  while i <= n measure -i by < do S end 
  states that termination of the loop can be proved by using (N,<)
  as the well-founded set and using -i as ranking function.

In the compiler:
* Correct a performance bug in the functions that inserts free statements
  and buries dead variables.
* An error has been corrected in the parser, which accepted "as type"
  for some local calls.

In the interpreter:
* One error in constructing the map data type has been corrected.
* One error in inserting new bindings into the map has been corrected.
* The mapentry type has been redefined for easier postprocessing.

Other:
* Errors in the grammar have been corrected and the grammar is now
  described in a less ambiguous manner.
* The processor for maude output has been extended.


creoltools 0.0l (2008-11-03): alpha release.

This version requires ocaml-libxml2 0.0h or later.  It will not compile
with any older version.

In the language:
* The type Real has been renamed to Float.
* The keyword fun has been renamed to function.
* The keyword extern has been renamed to external.

In the compiler:
* An error in type checking attribute initialisation has been corrected.
* Implementation of floating point numbers has been corrected.
* A couple of other errors have been corrected.

Other:
* The documentation has been updated.
* Unit tests were introduced to increas code quality.


creoltools 0.0k (2008-09-13): alpha release.

In the language:
* A new multicast statement has been added.  It looks like an asynchronous
  call statement (!e.m(args)), but e is not of an interface type but of a
  collection type (currently List[I], Set[I]) of object identifiers I.

In the standard library:
* A replace function has been added, which allows to use lists in a similar
  manner to arrays and vectors.
* A make_list function has been added that generates a list of N identical
  elements.
* A make range functon has been added, that generates a list of numbers
  between two bounds.
* More string functions have been added.
* A map type has been added.
* Make equality polymorphic.  Type checking is much more precise if
  = : [`a, `a -> Bool] instead of = : [Data, Data -> Bool]

In the interpreters:
* The CMC language has been revised to make it easily parseable for external
  tools.
* The interpreter has been refactored as a step towards using the Maude
  LOOP-MODE and the SOCKET facilities.
* Tail calls have been expanded and corrected.
* The interpreter supports an assert statement, that will stop the object's
  execution once the assertion fails.
* The interpreter includes a commit statement to have more precise model
  checking results.

In the compiler:
* Type checking is mandatory now to ensure correct code generation.
* Some errors in the type checker have been corrected.
* A pass that removes all assert statements has been added.
* The Maude backend has been updated to emit code for the new format.
* The XML backend has been made optional.
* A couple of code generation errors have been corrected.
* Must live analysis and must be defined analysis.
* Reinstate an updated version of tail-call optimisation.
* Many errors have been corrected.

Other:
* A new module demonstrates a parser for the Maude output.  This module
  may be used to pretty-print the output.
* A program has been added that validates the CMC output of Maude and
  that pretty prints these outputs.
* An index has been added to the manual.
* The CMC format has been extensively documented.
* A couple of errors in the configure/make machinery have been corrected.
* Documentation is now licensed under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation
  License v1.2

Known Bugs:
* This release contains a version of a check of use before definition.
  The current implementation does not work and has been disabled.


creoltools 0.0j (2008-06-09): alpha release.

In the standard library:
* Synchronised with the documentation.

In the interpreters:
* Cleaned up the declaration of constructors.
* Smaller optimisations.
* Correct the implementation of the timed interpreter.

creoltools 0.0i (2008-02-26): alpha release.

This is one of the latest release which allows to disable type checking
(we move to mandatory type checking in the 0.1 branch).

In the language:
* Initial constructs for the assertion language are accepted by the
  compiler and type checker.  The back-end does not emit any expressions
  for these yet.

In the compiler:
* The output format of this compiler has changed.  Models compiled with
  previous versions cannot run on the interpreter provided with this
  version and vice versa.
* The merge statement has been disabled, since to many passes of the
  compiler cannot handle it correctly.
* An initial version of an assertion language has been added.
* The compiler uses arbitrary precision integers and rationals now.
  The range for literals is now practically unlimited.
* Add a simple constant folding pass.
* Emit a place to store wild-card values in.
* More errors in the type checker have been corrected.
* The type checker checks whether the type hierarchy is acyclic.
* Better tests for ambiguity of method binding have been implemented.

In the standard library:
* Sets have been implemented and documented.
* "at" is now called "nth"

In the interpreter:
* Errors have been corrected.  Some equations where made rules because
  they were not confluent.
* The sort declarations are stricter now.  More equations and rules are
  sort-decreasing now.
* Rename some operators to play nicer with M4.
* Message queues have been moved into the objects for now.

Other:
* Document path insensitivity of the analysis.
* We require Maude 2.3 or later now.


creoltools 0.0h (2008-01-11): alpha release.

This is the latest release which allows to disable type checking.

In the language:
* datatype are not like modules anymore.  We may introduce modules later,
  but for now a datatype is just in the global space.
* datatypes declare their supertype by using the keyword of.  For example,
  datatype Int of Real declared Int as a subtype of Real.
* An attribute declaration may optionally be terminated with a semicolon.

In the compiler:
* An error in locating the prelude has been corrected.
* The compiler can search in different places for files now.
* Correct an error in the type checker which lost precision.
* Really check lower bounds on internal method calls.
* Attributes can be initialised directly now.  A missing init
  will be created.  Also, a missing run method will be created.
* Lowering trees to core creol has been reworked and corrected.
  All generated labels will be declared and initialised now.
* Searching for methods in interfaces and classes should be slightly
  faster and the implementation has been corrected for some corner
  cases.
* Passes for inserting free and bury statements have been added.  Passes
  exploit static analysis for figuring out which labes to free and which
  variables to bury.
* A devirtualisation pass has been added.
* Revise the implementation of the bury statement by expressing them
  as assignments.
* Added a backend to dot, allowing to visualise some aspects of
  a creol model/program.  Currently, only relations between classes
  and types.
* Many more errors have been corrected.
* Some attempt has been made in giving better error messages.

In the standard library:
* An error in the pair module has been corrected.

In the interpreter:
* The real-time interpreter should be executable now, if the system is
  initialised with a proper configuration and a ticking clock.
* Assignment order has been corrected with respect to shadowing.  This
  change was made possible by the generation of declarations for
  implicit labels as well as requiring declarations of all labels.
* The bury statement has been removed, because it is not safe anymore.
  It is replaced by an assignment to [null].

Other:
* The emacs lisp files have been removed and form their own projects
  now.
* The documentation has been updated.


creoltools 0.0g (2007-09-10): alpha release.

This version and all successive versions are now licensed under the terms
of the GPLv3 or (at your option) later.  See COPYING for details.

In the language:
* Labels must be declared now.  A label type has the form
  Label[t1, t2, ..., tn], where the ti represent the output
  types.  If a method does not have any outputs, the label type
  is Label[ ].  Observe that the white-space between the brackets
  is mandatory.
* Identifiers and types may contain numbers and _ now.  Variable names
  may contain ' characters.

In the compiler:
* The compiler includes a type checker now.  The type checker should be
  sound but it is not complete.  Please test and report errors.

In the standard library:
* Some functions and types have been added.

Other:
* All example programs from previous papers have been moved into the
  tests/examples directory.


creoltools 0.0f (2007-07-09): alpha release.

Please read the news for this release carefully, since the way creoltools
are build has been changed.

In the language:
* In order to avoid conflicts during parsing static attribute access
  expressions, the syntax has been changed.  The upper and lower
  bould constraints on method calls are given with the <: and :>
  operators.  A static access to an attribute is written as
  a@C.  The conflict arises after the sequence m@C{.,(}
* a@C is a left hand side operator now.
* The grammar for type variables, function types, and tuple types
  has been changed.
* Interfaces may a list of with_block declaration.

In the compiler:
* Guards in await statements will not be split into many await statements
  anymore.  This transformation made model checking slower.  It also
  introduced possible deadlocks.
* Sequence is represented as a binary operator, like merge and choice.
* Proper left hand side constructors are now defined.
* normalize_sequences will convert all sequences into a right-threaded
  format.
* Many cleanups have been integrated.

In the interpreter and model checker:
* The interpreter and the model checker have been optimized.  They run
  up to 15% faster now.
* Aid has been renamed to Vid and AidList to VidList.  Aid is the sort
  of 'String @@ Cid' now.
* An error in choosing the disabled branch in nondet has been corrected.

Other:
* The documentation has been updated.
* The libxml2 bindings have been removed from the repository, since to
  many linux distributions come with broken prerequisites and we want
  to avoid the maintenance nightmare.  The bindings are available as
  a separate package from <http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~kyas/creoltools/>.
  If you installed a previous version of creol tools, do not forget to
  uninstall the old bindings, e.g., using `ocamlfind remove xml' as
  root.


creoltools 0.0e (2007-06-22): alpha release.

In the compiler:
An infinite loop in parsing erroneous object creation statements has been
corrected.

The XML output has been improved.

In the interpreter:
To avoid errors on HFS+ file systems the runtime files of the interpreter
have been prefixed with creol-

Editing mode:
Pulled the maude mode maintained by Rudi and drop the older version from
the dirstribution.

Dropped the PDF from the distributed tar ball to keep the size of the
distribution reasonable.

An error in compiling the tool on MacOS has been corrected.

The configure scripts will warn about a missing maude.

The creol editing mode has been modularised into its own independently
distributable subpackage.

The spec file has been cleaned up.


creoltools 0.0d (2007-06-13): alpha release.

In the compiler:
Renamed await wait to release and corrected the semantics of this statement.
`await wait' has been replaced by `release'.  `release' will always suspend
control, even in merge statements.

WARNING: The semantic may still change in merge statements.
The expression language has been extended to include tuples.
Perform the lowering of Creol to the interpreted Core Creol in the
compiler.  The equations doing this have been removed from the interpreter.

In the interpreter:
Accepts Creol but only the Core language.
Smaller changes and corrections to make "search" do something useful and to
optimize method binding.

A script for collecting some information needed for error reporting has
been added.

The emacs editing mode for creol programs has been improved a little
bit.


creoltools 0.0c (2007-05-07): alpha release.

In the compiler:  
Functions use parenthesis instead of brackets.
The operator precedence for expressions has been rewritten.
A pretty printer is provided, which can be called with the `-target creol'
option.
Output for the model checker can be generated with the `-target maydemc'
switch.
The script `creolshell' compiles a file and launches maude with the
compiler output.
Errors have been corrected.

In the interpreter:
Some mistakes have been corrected.  await wait is now treated like an ordinary
statement, which is never enabled and always ready.  This simplifies its
treatment.


creoltools 0.0b (2007-03-16): alpha release.

The package has been renamed to `creoltools' and the compiler to `creolc'.
The pretty printer has been improved and it does not emit so many parenthesis.
Corrections to the maude interpreter and the model checker were made.
Output can now be stored as XML, use the flag -x name to write the abstract
syntax tree to the file name.  By default the output will now be written to
`out.maude'.  The file name can be overridden by supplying the option -o name.
If printing to the screen is desired, use `-o -' or `-x -'.



creolcomp 0.0a (2007-03-05): alpha release.

Documentation is very incomplete.  Parser works for some examples,
some error messages are slightly meaningful, and it generates code
for the Maude interpreter.
