0. The golden repository rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To safe us the pain of incomplete build, mysterious errors, and the like,
any file that can be built from other source files *must* *not* be
checked into the repository.  This is especially true for pdf files,
because subversion is especially bad in handling different versions of
such content (and pdftex/dvips insist on embedding the compilation
time into the file, causing new and different versions to be created).
If you do not observe this rule, we also have to expect check-in and
check-out times in the area of hours.

The only exception to this rule is the file README.  This file must be
present in order to regenerate the Makefile.in files using the command
`autoreconf' (see below).

This single exception gives rise to a second rule:  Whenever the file
info/readme.texi, which is the source for README, is commited to the
repository, the file README must be remade and commited in the same
transaction.  It is a serious error if a check-out triggers a rebuild
of the README file.


1. Installing the dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Building the creol tools from a subversion check-out requires more tools
in your development environment than just building the tools from a
source distribution.  Some generated files are included in the tar file
which are (in accordance with the golden rule) not checked into the
repository.  Make sure that you have the following programs installed:

  0. git

  1. Autoconf 2.59 or later

  2. Automake 1.9 or later

  3. Texinfo 4.8 or later

  4. ocaml 3.08 or later

  5. findlib 1.0 or later

  6. menhir

  7. ocaml-libxml2 0.0h or later (see
     <http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~kyas/creoltools>)

     a. gcc

     b. libxml 2.6.16 or later

     c. libxslt 1.1.11 or later

  8. graphviz (for the dot utility).

and what ever these tools will require in addition.


2. Installing missing files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This also means that after checking out the creoltools, and installing
or making sure that all dependencies are met, these generated files
are recreated.  Fortunately, this is a very simple procedure.

  1. After checking out the project from the repository, execute the
     command `autoreconf -i -s'.  This will create the configure
     script and the templates for the `Makefiles.in'.

  2. Execute the configure script to setup the build environment.
     make will then rebuild all files when needed.  Please respect
     the golden rule above.


* share/interpreter.m4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This file contains the code of both the interpreter and the model checker.
It is used to generate the Maude modules INTERPRETER and MODEL-CHECKER in
the files interpreter.maude and modelchecker.maude.

If you need to apply changes to the interpreter, you have to edit the
file interpreter.m4, since all changes to the other files may be
overwritten.

Additional parts of the interpreter are found in the files configuration.m4,
machine.m4, and predicates.m4.


* Coding style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Study the code and try to adhere the coding style.  A line is 80 characters
long, not longer.  Try to break around column 75.  This makes the code
printable.  Avoid mutable members and references.  All functions that
return a `Boolean' value should end in _p, which means ``predicate''.


* How to extend the compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you feel the need to add a function to the compiler, first check
whether there is a function defined which provides similar functionality.
Maybe the function can be used as is or adapted to your needs.

If you do not find such a function, write down a specification for
that function.  Put it into the source code.  Determine the most
suitable module for your new function, and add a declaration of that
function to that module.

Define unit tests for the function and add them to
'units/<module>Tests.ml'.  Make sure to cover as many behaviours as
possible.

Implement the function, and stay functional (there are a few places
where the compiler uses side effects but we want to minimise these
places).

Check the code base for as many places where your function can be used.
Maybe the function may obsolete some other function, which we can
remove.

* How to extend the interpreter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first consideration is to think about the extension and whether it
is really necessary.  If you can find a way to express the new
functionality using existing statements.  If this is the case, then do
not extend the interpreter.

If you find an extension that generalises existing functionality, then
your extension should replace the existing functionality it generalises.
This involves the following additional steps:

1. Update the backend to use your extension wherever the older, more
   special version is used.

2. Check and update all test cases.  Especially the behaviour of the
   execution and search tests must be maintained.

3. Update the documentation.
