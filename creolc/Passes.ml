(** A simple pass manager.

  The pass manager maintains a list of passes and whether they are
  enabled or not.  Individual passes can be enabled and disabled from
  the command line.  The pass manager tries to maintain all dependencies
  between passes.

    transformation performed by the pass.  [elapsed] is the
    time needed for executing that pass.  [enabled] is a
