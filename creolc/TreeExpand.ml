   This function will destroy some statement and expression
   annotations.  Therefore, all semantic analysis performed before
   this function should be repeated after calling this function.

   This should only concern type inference, because all other
   analysis should be performed after this function.

   The following two invariant holds for this function:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item A type correct program remains type correct and the
     annotations of unchanged statements are the same after
     reconstruction.
   \item [expand (expand tree) == expand tree]
   \end{itemize}
