(** {2 Type checker}

  This module implements the type checker for Creol.

  Because Creol features recursive types (interfaces may accept
  values of themselves), sub-typing, and method overloading, the formal
  theory of these types corresponds to System
  {% $F^{\omega}_{\wedge}$ %}.
  For this particular theory, type reconstruction is generally
  undecidable.

  The central ideas of this implementation are derived from Cardelli's
  implementation of {% $F_{<:}$ %}, which he has described
  in  cardelli93:_implem_f.  Using this algorithm, the type
  checker may reject some well-typed programs, because it fails to
  guess right, leading to sometimes puzzling error messages.  In
  practice, these situations do not occur often.  *)
